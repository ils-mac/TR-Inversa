# ¿Qué tipo de traducción es?

There's a lot of talk these days about how the issue of translation is solved by neural machine translation and generative AI. While professional practitioners may be aware of the idiocy of that stance, it is true that as translators, the machines are our competition. If we can't produce translations whose quality exceeds machine translation, we will quickly be replaced by automatic systems. For certain types of low risk content, we should be replaced. For medium and high risk content, we should also be able to distinguish between translations produced by both human and machines and say what makes the professionally produced human translation better.

This exercise is designed to get you thinking more about this.

## "Un-Verified Translation" and "Professionally Verified Translation"

The ASTM F43 subcommittee that produces international standards on translation is currently working on language to differentiate between unprofessional and professional translation. They have proposed the labels of *un-verified translation (UVT)* and *professionally verified translation (PVT)* to denote these two types of translation, though debate is still happening on the exact labels that will be used.

| Tipo de traducción | Descripción |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Un-Verified Translation (UVT) | - A translation that was generated by GAI or NMT upon which no professional verifications have been performed, aka "raw" or "unedited" MT<br>- A translation done by a person who is not professionally qualified to perform translation, such as a bilingual child or adult |
| Professionally Verified Translation (PVT) | - A translation that has been verified by a practitioner who has the qualifications necessary to perform professional translation, regardless of if GAI, NMT were or were not used to produce an initial draft translation |

In selecting the labels and defining them, the working group that is developing these labels were careful not to imply that human-produced content is inherently superior to machine translation. In fact, there are cases where MT would be preferred to having an unqualified human translator produce the translation. The concepts also reflect that professionals may or may not use MT to produce translations that are fit for purpose.

So what do you think? Can you distinguish between UVT and PVT from Spanish to English? Review the two translations below, and label them either UVT or PVT. Be sure to give a justification for your labels.

**Discussion Prompts**

1. Which translation is UVT and which is PVT?
2. How can you tell? That is, what observable characteristics do each of the translations have that point to how they were produced?

México ya está en negociaciones con Estados Unidos para proteger empresas y empleos

Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores | 12 de julio de 2025 | Comunicado

Informamos que el viernes 11 de julio una delegación mexicana de las secretarías de Economía,
Relaciones Exteriores, Hacienda, Seguridad Pública y Energía se reunió con los departamentos de Estado,
de Comercio y de Energía, además del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional y la oficina del Representante Comercial
de Estados Unidos para instalar la mesa de trabajo permanente binacional en la que serán desahogados
los principales temas de la relación. La mesa fue convocada por el Departamento de Estado y tendrá
la asistencia de todas las instancias que participan en los distintos asuntos.

Se trataron temas de seguridad, migración, frontera y gestión de aguas, así como la relación económica
entre ambos países. Nos fue dado a conocer que, como parte del cambio profundo en la política comercial
de Estados Unidos, todos los países recibirían una carta signada por el presidente de los Estados Unidos,
estableciendo nuevas tarifas a partir del 1° de agosto. Mencionamos en la mesa que era un trato injusto
y que no estábamos de acuerdo.

Se convino que la primer gran tarea de la mesa permanente binacional será conducir los trabajos
para que antes de esa fecha tengamos una alternativa que permita proteger empresas y empleos en
ambos lados de la frontera. Resulta muy relevante haber establecido desde el 11 de julio la vía y
el espacio necesarios para resolver cualquier posibilidad de que entren en vigor nuevos aranceles
el 1° de agosto. Es decir, México ya está en negociaciones.

Mexico is Negotiating with the United States to Safeguard Businesses and Jobs

Secretary of Foreign Affairs | July 12, 2025 | Press Release

On Thursday, July 11 a Mexican delegation from the Ministries of the Economy, Foreign Affairs, Finance,
Public Security and Energy met with the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce and Energy, along with the
National Security Council and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a permanent binational
roundtable for addressing key matters related to our relations. The roundtable was convened by the Department
of State, and all agencies with an interest in related issues will participate.

During the meeting, the topics of security, migration, border and water management were discussed, along with
the economic relationship between the two countries. We were informed that due to the sweeping shift taking place
in U.S. trade policy, President Trump would be sending letters to all countries, informing them of their new August 1
tariff rates. We expressed our disagreement at the roundtable, saying that this course of action was unfair.

Therefore, we agreed that the first major task of the permanent binational roundtable would be to work to ensure that
before that date we have an alternative that will safeguard business and jobs on both sides of the border. It was very much
in our interest to have established the communication channels in this July 11 meeting for overcoming the possibility
of new tariffs taking effect on August 1. That is to say, Mexico is negotiating already.

Mexico is already in negotiations with the United States to protect companies and jobs

Ministry of Foreign Affairs | July 12, 2025 | Press release

We hereby announce that on Friday, July 11, a Mexican delegation from the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs,
Finance, Public Security, and Energy met with the Departments of State, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the
National Security Council and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, to establish a permanent binational
working group to address key issues in the relationship. The working group was convened by the Department of State
and will be attended by all the agencies involved in the various issues.

Issues such as security, migration, borders, and water management were discussed, as well as the economic relationship
between the two countries. We were informed that, as part of the profound change in U.S. trade policy, all countries
would receive a letter signed by the President of the United States establishing new tariffs effective August 1.
We mentioned at the table that this was unfair and that we did not agree with it.

It was agreed that the first major task of the permanent binational committee will be to work to ensure that, before
that date, we have an alternative that will protect businesses and jobs on both sides of the border. It is very important
that, since July 11, we have established the necessary channels and space to resolve any possibility of new tariffs coming
into effect on August 1. In other words, Mexico is already in negotiations.
