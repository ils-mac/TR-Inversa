# Narrative Theory when Navigating Identities in Mexican Spanish to U.S. English Translation

Last week, we learned that when translating between Mexican Spanish and U.S. English, there are histories and ideologies that we need to navigate, such as the U.S. belief in Manifest Destiny as justification for colonization and genocide, a "buena vencinidad" between Mexico and the United States historically benefiting to a far greater degree the United States, and what Mexican's view as the "special relationship" between these two countries. These types of stories are the narratives of culture and identity that circulate among the groups of people that speak certain languages. In the case of Mexican Spanish to U.S. English translation, we need to be aware of the myths (such as the U.S. being any kind of moral authority) that are alluded to or stated explicitly in the content we translate. We also need to be aware of the narratives projected onto groups of people through discriminatory stereotpyes, and counter-narratives that address the inaccuracies of the very powerful status quo. Mona Baker's narrative theory is a useful framework for bringing this kind of awareness to translation work.
