# Traducciónes Literarias - Ejemplos

As a bonus to our unit on literary translation, let's share examples of some of our favorite literary translations. If we can, we'll share a copy of the ST and the TT. Otherwise, we can give information about how people can purchase or request copies of the translation. Then, when recommending the translation, we can do so by sharing some initial thoughts or by carrying out more in depth analysis.

## Recommending Spanish to English Literary Translations

We'll recommend translations in the Teams channel called `TradLit Recomendaciones`. A suggested format for your posts is:

```
Asunto: Illustrative Title for your Recommendation
Analysis por: Your Names
Description of the ST: Short description of the literary work, the trama, the genre, and the type of linguistic conventions used
Why you particularly like the translation:
Attachments:
- Source Text and Target Text (if possible)
- Any additional context or analysis to support your recommendation

```

### A note on File Naming
Please be organized about the files that you share with us. We should be able to easily understand what the contents of each file are from the file name.

**Suggested File Naming Conventions**
- Source texts: `AuthorsLastName(s)_AbbreviatedTitle_ST
- Target texts: `AuthorsLastName(s)_TranslatorsLastName(s)_AbbreviatedTitle_TT`
- Analyses/Contexts: `AuthorsLastNames_AbbreviatedTitle`

For example:
- `Paz_MonoGramático-Chapter_ST.pdf`
- `Paz_Lane_MonkeyGrammarian-Chapter_TT.pdf`
- `Brandt_DeconstructionistMonkeyGrammarian.pdf`

## Recommendation: Octavio Paz’s _El mono gramático_ and Helen R. Lane’s _The Monkey Grammarian_

**Asunto:** The Deconstructionist Monkey Grammarian: Writing and Reading in Octavio Paz’s El mono gramático and Helen R. Lane’s Translation
**Analysis por:** Alaina Brandt

**Description of the ST:**
"In El mono gramático, Octavio Paz tests the limits of language and confronts and challenges the traditional use of metaphor, analogy and other literary conventions. Remarkably, Paz carries out this rebellion through the use of those same devices, blurring the traditional borders assumed to exist among writers, readers and texts. In the book, Paz recalls travelling on a path to Galta. However, this journey is superimposed by another—a journey in which the text itself is likened to a path through which both writer and reader must pass." (Brandt, 2012)

**Why you particularly like the translation:**
I'm drawn to El mono gramático and Lane's translation because they embody the very instability of meaning I find compelling in deconstructionist theory. Paz's text refuses to let language settle into fixed meanings—his exploration of fijeza as "siempre momentánea" demonstrates how even attempts to capture stability dissolve into metaphors of metaphors, with meaning perpetually deferred. Lane doesn't merely reproduce Paz's Spanish but creates her own intimate reading, one that sometimes amplifies his ideas through subtle shifts, reinforcing the spatial-temporal confusion Paz explores. Both writer and translator engage openly with translation's "necessary impossibility"—Paz's assertion that the grove of trees is "intraducible" while simultaneously being named, and Lane's acceptance that no "monogamous relationship" exists between original and translation. What makes this relationship particularly compelling is how each text performs deconstruction differently yet harmoniously, with Lane's article choices suggesting completed transformations where Paz implies ongoing process, creating what Benjamin called not "reproduction but harmony." Ultimately, Both texts demonstrate that writing and reading are acts of traversing an impossible path toward meaning that can never fully arrive, yet the journey itself generates the echoes that make language—and translation—worthwhile.

The last attachment is a paper I wrote on El modo gramático, deconstructionist theory, and translation as reading and writing back in 2012.
