# Siendo Simpático en La Traducción

Last week we were introduced to the concept of being simpático en la traducción in [the interview of Mexican literary translator Dr. George Henson](../semana13/entrevista-gHenson-traductorLiterario-esMX-enUS.md).

This week you'll be translating the literature you selected for your literary project last week. In your translation, one of goals will be authenticity. This authenticity is achieved by either being a part of the discourse community with whom you are communicating, or by replicating the discourse of a community when you are an outsider from it. The idea of "being simpatico" is that when you're an insider who is translating that lends credibility and authenticity to your work. Here, we're going to consider some important discussions to form our own opinions about whether one needs to be "simpatico" to translate.

The focus on this page is Lawrence Venuti's chapter "Simpatico" from *The Translator's Invisibility*.

## Terminology Note

How did simpatico as a term for this concept of authenticity come to be terminologized in the field of translation?

According to Lawrence Venuti's "Simpactico" chapter that we discuss in this lesson:

> The translator works better when he and the author are simpatico, said my friend, and by this he meant not just "agreeable," or "congenial," meanings which this Italian word is
often used to signify, but also "possessing an underlying sympathy" (237). The translator
should not merely get along with the author, not merely find him likeable; there
should also be an identity between them.

## Background / Case Study in Being Simpatico in Translation

Add the important contenxt about the debate around the translation of the Amanda Gorma poem
Here's the NPR article: https://www.iowapublicradio.org/2021-03-26/translations-of-amanda-gormans-inaugural-poem-spark-debate-can-white-translators-interpret-it

Here's my and George's discussion of the issue in the interview we did in trascript form, in case you can take anything away from this for a summary of this case study.
Also do you think it's respectful to refer to a manifestation of somethign being called a cultural misappropriation as a case study?



of well I guess continuing with questions of identity as well. There was
1:17:17
I'm curious to get your opinion because back in 2021 um Amanda Gorman uh you know she had her
1:17:24
inaugural poem. This ended up being translated. It was translated into Dutch
1:17:30
by a non-binary translator who was white and a black Dutch writer who isn't named
1:17:37
in this NPR article that I'm eventually going to mention um called into question
1:17:42
the fact that you know maybe it would have been better to have a person who is
1:17:48
black, a person who has had experiences of of of racism and you know systemic
1:17:55
discrimination and things like that actually do the translation, have somebody who's also a spoken word uh
1:18:02
uh poet do the translation. So, this idea that somebody's identity uh should
1:18:09
match with the identity of the author that they're translating in order for them to be able to do the translation.
1:18:15
There was an article by NPR on this topic. The ATA re uh reposted the
1:18:21
article by NPR. Unfortunately, the article by NPR uh kind of took well not
1:18:28
kind of but it took a view of the situation that was really dismissive of
1:18:34
the criticism that was happening. Um was
1:18:40
dismissive of um thinking about people's concerns about racial representation in
1:18:47
translation. Um it was an article that oversimplified identity politics. um
1:18:52
excluded themes of racial justice. It didn't feature anyone speaking about the topic who was racialized as a black
1:19:00
person. It only featured uh Caucasian people speaking about the issues and saying that no, it's perfectly fine that
1:19:07
you know a white person um who's not a um spoken language poet has translated
1:19:14
this um black American spoken language poet. Um, so ATA was criticized for
1:19:21
being tonedeaf um by reposting that that article at a race and linguistics panel
1:19:27
that I attended in 2021. Um, the panel was um, black translators, black
1:19:34
localizers. I wonder what you think about that. Like I wondered if there's female Mexican art authors that you'd
1:19:41
like to translate and I wonder if you think that like when do you need to share the g the identity not even gender
1:19:48
identity but when do you need to share the identity characteristics of the person you're translating in order to be
1:19:54
able to have a authentic translation? Well, believe it or not, we talked about
1:20:00
this actually yesterday in my literary translation. Really? Um, it's a very
1:20:05
complicated issue, and I'm not saying that to get out of, you know, of of
1:20:12
responding to it. Uh, but it's a very nuanced um it's very a nuanced um situation
1:20:21
that's hard to um
1:20:27
give the time that it deserves, right? Um and the attention and the seriousness
1:20:33
it deserves. Um the the the initial response and the
1:20:39
response that NPR and I'm I'm aware of that column that NPR gave was white
1:20:45
people being offended, right? And I actually saw this play out on I used to be on Twitter. Um I've
1:20:52
since deleted my Twitter account, but your students can find me on Blue Sky on
1:20:58
and on Instagram. Um, I've followed all of that and I
1:21:03
probably commented on it as well. Um, but you had a lot of white and largely
1:21:09
white male, you know, and so it's the white male who's constantly feeling
1:21:15
attacked, right? Um, and so you had a lot of white male translators who
1:21:22
otherwise might identify as being liberal or progressive who really got
1:21:27
their feelings hurt, right? And that's what it boils down to. Um, and so it was
1:21:34
this knee-jerk reaction. But going back to what we talked about, um, earlier,
1:21:40
there is this belief that anyone can translate anything. I'm good enough of a
1:21:46
translator that I can translate anything, right? That's just simply not
1:21:52
true. And I commented that there are things that I don't think I can translate.
1:21:58
I think and so Venudi actually has an article that I can send you as well that
1:22:04
doesn't speak about this directly but he's he he talks about indirectly and
1:22:13
um Randolph no Randall or what's his name? Oh my gosh, Valent Russell Valentino talks about this in a blog
1:22:20
post. Russell Valentino is a really well-known translator from I think Russian or other Slavic languages
1:22:27
teaches at the University of Indiana and he's uh very prominent in Alta. Uh he brings up this notion of
1:22:35
what's called sympatico, right? Uh does the translator
1:22:41
need to be sympatico, which means share some kind of affinity?
1:22:47
uh either identity is probably the most obvious form of affinity
1:22:53
with the writer in order to be able to translate the writer. Uh yeah, then he references no he just says if you want
1:23:00
to know what Venui has to say about Simpatico, he's written about it a great
1:23:06
deal. So I found an article that Venucci wrote and he doesn't address this particular incident because I think the
1:23:13
article was written before it but he kind of dismantles this whole notion
1:23:18
about sympatico h being sympatico with the writer and what does that mean? M
1:23:26
um I think what for me what it boils down to is a question of whether or not someone can translate something. But can
1:23:35
can mean two things meaning can meaning do they have the
1:23:40
ability and can do they have the right so those are two different things
1:23:47
and I think people were kind of conflating them and getting lost.
1:23:53
So first of all I don't think that everyone can meaning they have the ability to translate everything I and
1:24:01
for because for me what is important is being able to find the voice the
1:24:08
author's voice what is the what is the author's voice what what are the
1:24:13
characters voices that are coming through I could not translate something
1:24:19
written in a dialect to 20 year olds or even 30 year olds.
1:24:24
Um Elena in her in her collection has a short story about
1:24:33
um these about uh this girl who's um is
1:24:41
addicted to huffing glue on the street. to all these
1:24:48
street children who are sniffing glue. Um, that was very hard for me. One, I
1:24:54
don't know a lot about that. So, I had to do a lot of research. I mean, how do these people speak in English that can I
1:25:02
do justice to this? Could I translate something
1:25:08
about a 20year-old indigenous person from
1:25:15
Panama? No, I couldn't. I don't know how those people speak and I don't know how
1:25:22
to recreate it in English, right? Uh but there's this belief, you
1:25:28
know, that white men, you know, white men are going to be white men. You know, they think they know everything and can
1:25:34
and I'm a white man, but I'm at least gay. So, I come at this from a perspective of, you know, to a certain
1:25:40
extent I am a minority, right? Um, but white straight men, YC, white
1:25:49
cisgendered straight men think that they can do everything right.
1:25:55
Um, and it hurts their ego to say that you can't because at the same time they're
1:26:02
saying what they're hearing is you don't have the ability to do it,
1:26:08
which offends their sense of professionalism and we're not going to
1:26:14
let you do it, right? Um, and so they feel attacked
1:26:20
on two fronts there. Um, do I
1:26:26
think that you have to share some identity category with someone in order
1:26:33
to translate them? I think it helps. I think that you need to be aware
1:26:40
of the limitations of your language. I know lots of language. I'm 64 64 years
1:26:46
old. I've lived in many places. I've known people of all socioeconomic
1:26:52
backgrounds including family. I've traveled a lot. Um I've got a PhD. I
1:27:00
have a lot of language at my disposal. That mean that I have all language at my
1:27:05
disposal, right? Um I I looked back at the poem and I'm
1:27:12
thinking, okay, what is there particular in this poem that is reflective of the
1:27:17
black experience? Not a lot, right? That doesn't mean that because
1:27:25
other than this poem, there was a there was a larger collection of poetry that was being translated. I wouldn't translate it
1:27:32
because I do think you need to be a spoken word poet. I think there at the
1:27:37
very minimum, right? Because spoken word poetry is so specific, right? I have to
1:27:46
be able to recreate the that I don't have the sensibility to recreate that
1:27:52
genre. So let's start with that genre. Yeah. Then it then if there is something
1:28:00
within that genre within a particular piece that a white person absolutely
1:28:07
cannot identify. Because if you're if you're asking a white
1:28:14
person to recreate language that they did not grow up
1:28:21
speaking, and by that I mean idiomatic language or dialectical language,
1:28:27
right? I mean, if you don't want this poem to sound
1:28:32
like it was written by a white man, you don't. Or even a white
1:28:38
woman. Um so I think there is a benefit to share
1:28:44
because I there are multiple identity categories and each person possesses
1:28:49
multiple identity charact categories the most the the more overlap there is on
1:28:55
the vin diagram right yeah yeah I think I think that that gives the translator
1:29:05
um an a an advantage message that other translators may not
1:29:11
have. I think a lot of translators need to to sit back and say, "Hey, I can't do
1:29:19
this." You know what I think gets drawn in there um is also this idea
1:29:27
that that translators are
1:29:33
uh windows into another culture. translators are. I remember reading a
1:29:40
paper in my uh translation theory class back when I was doing my masters that it
1:29:45
really captured my attention at the time. I loved it and it took me a really long time to realize the problems with
1:29:52
the metaphor, but it talked about the translator being a chameleon. And it took me a really long time to realize
1:29:58
like the metaphor of me as a white woman being able to change my skin color to
1:30:05
like match the like that's what it's saying. That's what that metaphor is saying is that I can adopt the identity
1:30:11
of a person from another culture and transparently convey uh whatever it is
1:30:18
that they have to say. And that's just I mean it's obviously very problematic.
1:30:23
And so I think that's Yeah. I'll give you a concrete example of something that I translated a very long short story by
1:30:31
a Cuban writer Miguel Barnett. It was called Fatima Park de laad. This is a
1:30:38
10,000word essentially monologue. It was written in one It was written in first person in one voice from start to
1:30:45
finish. And the narrator protagonist was a drag queen in
1:30:52
Cuba. Now I'm gay. I was at one point in my life a drag queen. Uh I know how drag
1:30:59
queens speak. I know how they speak when they are with each other.
1:31:06
Um and this particular short story was translated by
1:31:12
two people, me and a straight woman.
1:31:18
And I think my translation is better. Why do I think it's better? Because I
1:31:25
know how drag queens talk. Yeah. Right. I don't think if you have not been
1:31:33
around drag queens, if you've not listened to them, if you've not spoken
1:31:40
with them, if you've not lived in that language, you don't know how to recreate
1:31:48
that language. you know, you don't know how to say things like and all those [ __ ] at, you know, all those [ __ ]
1:31:54
at Fraternity Park, right? Um, even though the text in in Spanish may not
1:32:01
say [ __ ] right? Yeah. I don't remember particularly because this has been a very long time what it says, but
1:32:07
I know that that's the equivalent. That's what a drag queen would would call these other drag queens, right? Yeah.
1:32:17
Um, so if you don't know how drag queens talk and just wa watching a few a few
1:32:25
episodes or of uh Drupal's Drag Race isn't going to do it. And actually it
1:32:31
got published it got translated and published before RuPaul's Drag Race. But my point there
1:32:38
is how is someone who's not been immersed in drag queen culture going to
1:32:44
know what a drag queen sounds like? I've been starting to talk about too because we talk about subject matter
1:32:51
experts a lot. Um I think we need to talk more about in culture experts
1:32:58
because when you bring subject matter experts into it there is this idea that I mean and obviously for certain time
1:33:04
types of text you want a subject matter expert. Um for like scientific technical
1:33:09
you want somebody who knows uh who knows the subject of the content they're
1:33:15
translating. Um, I think subject matter expert is also a term that could be used to refer to somebody who is a cultural
1:33:23
expert, but it doesn't acknowledge the cultural piece to it enough. No, that's
1:33:29
that those are very analogous because as I'm, you know, I teach students how to
1:33:34
translate uh within domains that I'm not a subject matter expert in, but I know
1:33:41
how to do the research to be able to do so to do the translation. What I tell my
1:33:47
students is every every subject has its own language. M there's a way economists
1:33:54
speak and not just referring to terminology right there are terms of
1:34:01
phrase there is a there is an economics language there's a scientific language
1:34:06
there is a legal language and if you're not used to dealing living working in
1:34:13
that language you can tell that this was not this was not translated by a subject
1:34:18
matter expert right the Same tr the same thing is true
1:34:23
culturally. So I was to some extent a subject matter expert in drag queen language,
1:34:30
right? Yeah. And you can extrapolate that to say that I am a subject matter
1:34:36
expert in spoken word poetry, which I'm not, but I think I would need to be. So
1:34:42
being able literary translators and I I love that you brought this up because I don't think I think the analogy is
1:34:49
perfect but I don't think literary translators think of it in these terms. You need to be a subject matter expert
1:34:57
to work within this cultural context. Yeah. cultural
1:35:04
meaning, you know, not only referring to being country specific, right, but also
1:35:10
being language specific and being identity specific as well.
1:35:15
Exactly.

## Lawrence Venuti on Being Simpatico

### Activities & Discussion Questions

#### Key Terminology

1. Throughout the text, Venuti refers to his translations of the experimentalist poetry of Milo De Angelis from Italian to English as "interpretive translation"? What distinction is Venuti trying to make about his translations in comparison to conventional translations?
2. In the chapter, Venuti describes translation as: interpretation, transformation, mistification. What similar metaphors does Venuti use for translation, and what do those metaphors convey?
3. In approaching cornerstone ideas in writing and translations, Venuti uses phrases like "abusive fidelity" and "kidnapping, and his translation of the poem "The Train Corridor" uses the words plagiary and resemblance. What does this terminology convey about his thoughts on the authenticity and authority of the translation.
4. Understanding that both the author he wanted to translate and the style in which he would translate wouldn't be acceptable to the mainstream, Venuti identifies "resistance" as his translation strategy. What pulls should translators try to resist in translation? Why is translating without a broader audience than the translator her- or himself as the reader considered to be resistance?
5. Venuti refers to his resistant translations as an act of deterritorialization of the English language in writing, and the act of reading by the audience as reterritorialization of the English language. How should we understand "deterritorialization" and "reterritorialization"?

> The ideal situation occurs, my friend believed, when the translator discovers his
author at the start of both their careers. In this instance, the translator can closely
follow the author’s progress, accumulating exhaustive knowledge of the foreign
texts, strengthening and developing the affinity which he already feels with his
author’s ideas and tastes, becoming, in effect, of the same mind... The voice that the reader hears in any translation made on the basis of *simpatico* is always recognized as the author's, never as a translator's, nor even as some hybrid of the two. (237-238)

> De Angelis's poetry questions whether the translator can be (or should be thought of as being) in sympathy with the foreign author. It rather shows that voice in translation is irreducibly strange, never quite recognizable as the poet's or the translator's, never quite able to shake off its foreignness to the reader. (248)

> As I began to translate De Angelis's poems, I became aware that the notion of *simpatico* actually mystifies what happens in the translation process. Most crucially, it conceals the fact that, in order to produce the effect of transparency in a translated text, in order to give the reader the sense that the text is a window onto the author, translators must manipulate what often seems to be a very resistant material, that is, the language into which they are translating, in most cases the language they learned first, their mother tongue, but now also their own (248).

> These formal techniques reveal that transparency is an illusionistic effect: it depends on the translator’s work with language, but it hides this work, even the very presence of language, by suggesting that the author can be seen in the translation, that in it the author speaks in his or her own voice. If the illusion of transparency is strong enough, it may well produce a truth-effect, wherein the authorial voice becomes authoritative, heard as speaking what is true, right, obvious. (249)

> Because transparent discourse is perceived as mirroring the author, it values the foreign text as original, authentic, true and devalues the translated text as derivative, simulacral, false, forcing on translation the project of effacing its second-order status with a fluent strategy. (251)

> What could I hope to achieve by translating De Angelis into English? What theory would inform my translation strategy and govern my choices? (251)

> [M]y strategy can be called resistancy: it seeks to reproduce the discontinuity of De Angelis’s poem. (251)

> At the same time, however, implementing this strategy must not be viewed as making the translation more literal or more faithful to the foreign-language text. Although resistancy can be said to rest on the same basic assumptions about language and subjectivity that inform De Angelis's poetry, my English version still deviates from the Italian text in decisive ways that force a radical rethinking of fidelity in translation. (252)

> As a consequence, the translation establishes an abusive fidelity to the Italian text: on the one hand, the translation resists the transparent aesthetic of British and American cultures which would try to domesticate De Angelis's difficult writing by demanding a fluent strategy; on the other hand, the translation simultaneously creates a resistance in relation to De Angelis's text, qualifying its meaning with additions and subtractions which constitute a "critical thrust" towards it. (252)

> [M]y interpretive translation should be seen as a transformation of the poem, grounded, it is true, on information about De Angelis's readings in literature, literary criticism, and philosophy, but aimed at circulating this body of writing in Anglophone cultures where it continues to be alien and marginal. (253)

> No, the interpretation has fixed a meaning, enabling the translation both to go beyond and fall short of De Angelis’s poem. (255)

> My interpretive translation exceeds the foreign-language text, supplementing it with research that indicates its contradictory origins and thereby puts into question its status as the original, the perfect and self-consistent expression of authorial meaning of which the translation is always the copy, ultimately imperfect in its failure to capture that self-consistency. The fact is that the original can be seen as imperfect, fissured by conflicting ideas, by the philosophical materials it puts to work, and the translation has made this conflict clearer. (255)

> Abusive fidelity can be achieved by various strategies of resistancy worked by various formal techniques, but more often than not the techniques surface accidentally as possibilities are tested, their effects evaluated only after the fact, when rationalization occurs. (256)

[The quotes below here are for the poem about a lover's quarrel]
> [M]aybe the accuser should be abandoning any search for authentic existence, any effort to avoid the dishonesty of imitation, because desire always has contradictory determinations, frustrations, "delays." (257)

> ...where two lovers are locked in a struggle for dominance and each can disprove ("confuto") the other's representation of their relationship, imposing a "world" that "will be true" for both. At this point, the voices lose what vague definition they may have acquired as the text unfolded, and the two conflicting positions of intelligibility are finally abandoned by the last voice, which implicitly calls for silence, full of expectation for another, still unspoken "word" that will construct a new subject-position for "the body," a new representation for the biological "force" that threatens the linguistic basis of every
relationship. (257-258)

> Thus desire is seen as driving language use, but also as depending on such use for its articulation. (258)

> Combined with "resemblance" in the translation, "plagiary: becomes a pun which in itself brands any relationship based on identity as a crime against personal autonomy and individuality, a Heideggerian inauthenticity, a person-theft, conjuring up its Latin root plagiarius – kidnapper. (259)
[The quotes above here are for the poem about a lover's quarrel]

> In a polemical essay published in 1967, Kenneth Rexroth wondered, "Why is American Poetry Culturally Deprived?" because he "never met an American poet who was familiar with Jean Paul Sartre's attempts at philosophy, much less with the gnarled discourse of Scheler or Heidegger"
(Rexroth 1985: 59). (261)

> The liberating moment would occur when the reader of the resistant translation experiences, in the translating language, the cultural differences which separate that language and the foreign text. (264)

> Translation is a process that involves looking for similarities between languages and cultures – particularly similar messages and formal techniques – but it does this only because it is constantly confronting dissimilarities. (264)

> In contrast, the notion of *simpatico*, by placing a premium on transparency and demanding
a narrowly conceived fluent strategy, can be viewed as a cultural narcissism: it seeks an identity, a self-recognition, and finds only the same culture in foreign writing, only the same self in the cultural other. (264)

#### Discussion 

He's talking about all of the research - correspondence with the author, understanding of philosophies like Nietzsche and Heidegger and Lacan to which the author subscribed, a careful process of drafting and weighing options to get what is ultimately a translation with bright spots and limitations that ultimately represents the translator's understanding of and work on the text. Here, the translator's work is just that, weighing word choice, navigating what two languages can and can't do, navigating the idiolect of a specific author...

What does this mean to think of translation as resistence? He knew that this author wouldn't sell, and without readers has to ask himself what is the point of translation? Does resistance become the point? Doing the work for oneself? Doing the work for the art of it? He was right about sellability - his work is often rejected for the strangeness it maintains.

The second poem of his is interesting in its quarrel between two lovers. What about applying this poem to the plagiary of translation?

**Research & Writing Opportunity**
What else has been stated about "being simpatico" in translation? What gaps in the literature could you fill by sharing your perspective? (Here I'm trying to make up for the fact that this entire lesson features what white men have to say about being simpatico in translation. Let's make this fact explicit to students and encourage them to find or contribute alterative viewpoints.)

> This episode has brought to mind a rather contentious exchange between Cherrie Morraga and Bob Shacochis that I witnessed at a conference on the promise of empathy at the University of Iowa in early 2002, in which Shacochis insisted he could “imagine his way” into the point of view of anyone as a way of writing a piece of fiction, including, for instance, an antebellum slave woman on a Georgia plantation, while Morraga equally insistently claimed that he could not, and if he did, he would be exploiting the suffering of people who really had experienced that imagined point of view. At the time, at least, there was no common ground. The artist claimed he could do it. The activist said don’t you dare.

## Conclusions

Just as claims about the ability to achieve 100% accuracy in translation minimalize the skill and strategy involved in producing a translation that successfully navigates the losses and gains that are inherent when rendering content from one language to another, relying on cultural affinity to explain what makes a translation "authentic" does the same.

Still, cultrual affinity helps, or at least striving to becoming an insider within the the discourse community for whom you are translating, or working with in-culture experts to ensure the translation is culturally correct.
