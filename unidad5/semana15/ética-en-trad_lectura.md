# Mis Experiences Desarrollando la Ética en Traducción - Lectura



## ATA - Código de Ética: Desde 2010 hasta 2022

One activity you can complete in the exercises on the next page is to compare the 2010 to the 2022 version of the ATA Code of Ethics to understand recent changes that have taken place to this code. At the time that the revisions that produced the 2022 version of the code were taking place, I served on the ATA Board of Directors and participated in the revisions process by sharing my comments on deveoping changes to the code. Here, I share about the revisions process with you, so that you can understand how professional codes are developed.

## Code of Professional Conduct of Localization Managers / Localizer's Code of Conduct

## My Code of Ethics as a Professor

As an instructor, I've only thought it fair to share my personal code of ethics if I'm asking my students to write and share their own personal codes. One activity you can complete in this module is to write your personal translation code. As an example, I've included the code I wrote and shared with my students at the end of my first semester formally teaching translation and localization at MIIS below. 

```
Code of Conduct of a New TLM Professor

As I new professor of translation and localization management, I solemnly swear that…

I will learn to write instructions that are easy to decipher… 
I will not unnecessarily complicate projects and tasks.
I will push students to produce a lot of bad art, 
knowing that art produced over and again 
goes from bad to better and better in the act of repetition (Chris Do). 
Still, I will assign a volume of work that is realistic.
I will get out of my students’ way when it’s best to do so. 
I will give students the microphone.
I will engage in collaboration with students and 
get comfortable existing within the ambiguity of the learning process. 
I will listen for possibility in the digestion of new ideas 
instead of growing fearful of uncertainty (Adam Kahane).
I will be radically candid, by caring personally and being open 
to receiving a lot of radically candid feedback on my performance 
as an instructor myself (Kim Scott).
I will share challenging (which is to say painful) professional experiences in my teaching, 
if it will allow students to avoid making the same mistakes I did.
I will stress the importance of reading the fine print.
I will stress the importance of reading the fine print.
I will stress the importance of reading the fine print.
I won't do my best, I'll do what it takes to give students the educational experience they deserve.
I am also mostly up to no good (J.K. Rowling).
Mischief managed.

**Note on Harry Potter / J.K. Rowling reference:** Since writing a book series that is adored by fans worldwide, J.K. Rowling has made statements with regards to transgender women that are incredibly offensive. Citing this person's work in no way endorses an antagonistic worldview towards this group of people.

## Conclusions
Baker: "Beyond equivalence: ethics and morality"
> "[C]odes, like laws, are elaborated by people like us and are therefore never infallible, ethically or otherwise... [I]t is your responsibility to question the code in order to avoid causing harm to others or perpetuating potential forms of injustice." (Baker, 274)
