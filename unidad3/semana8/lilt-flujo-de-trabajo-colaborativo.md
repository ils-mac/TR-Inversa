## Technological Workflows - Surfacing Issues

Let's also address common issues that occur when working collaboratively in technological platforms, along with any issues you've encountered as you've worked with Lilt. The faster we can surface issues, the faster we can attend to them.

**Discussion Questions**

- What went well about working in Lilt specifically?
- What is one new small feature of Lilt that you learned while working on this assignment?
- What hasn't gone so well about the collaborative projects?
- In what ways do you feel that the source segmentation helps you to produce quality work? Hinders you?
- Anything else you'd like to report?
