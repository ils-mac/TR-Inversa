# Introduction to Label Studio

Label Studio is an open-source, professional annotation environment that professionals use to annotate the data that is used to train LLMs. Follow along with the professor as she shows how to create and annotate (evaluate) projects in Label Studio. 

## Getting Access to Label Studio

You have been provided with a private link on Teams to access the Label Studio platform. Please follow that link and create your account in Label Studio.

**Note:** The invitation link gives you access to the professor's full, private instance of Label Studio. Please be careful not to change any major settings or delete any projects once you get into the system. If a project is deleted before everyone has completed it, we'll all need to do our work all over again. Also, record your passwords carefully. There is no way for you to recover your account if you've lost your password. You can reach out to the instructor to have your password reset, and if she is not available for that, you'll just need to create a new account.

## Technological Training Project

In the technological training project, the focus is on gaining familiarity with the Label Studio technology, not with the linguistic aspects of translation quality evaluations.

Areas of the platform to make note of:
- Project Dashboard
- Labeling Interface
  - Main labeling area
  - Error assignment area (Dimensions, Errors, Severity, Notes)
  - List of annotations
  - Document-level rating area 

## Linguistic Training Project

In the linguistic training project, the focus is on taking the time to get familiar with marking translation errors according to the MQM framework. But first, we should discuss: What's different about the Label Studio environment in comparison to how editing is carried out in translation technology like CAT tools?
