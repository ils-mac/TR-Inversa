# Translation Quality Management Systems

Up to this point in the class, you've been participating in a translation quality management system in which you do translations, your work is evaluated for individual errors across X dimensions, and that data is analyzed to determine correspondence and readability scores to ultimately determine effectiveness. 

## Review of Key Terminology
- correspondence
- readability
- translation effectiveness

This week, you'll take on the role of the evaluator. You can learn more about that role next.

## Translation Quality Management Repository

**Required reading:** [README for alainamb's Translation Quality Management repository (repo) on GitHub](https://github.com/alainamb/translation-quality-mgmt)

**Discussion Questions**
- What are the roles in the translation quality management system presented?
- What are the goals of completing quality evaluations?
- What is the reasoning behind the technological approach taken, i.e. annotating projects in Label Studio rather than doing so in CAT tools?
- What are the goals specifically of annotating (labeling) texts with translation errors?
- According to the README, what are the shortcomings of the system?
